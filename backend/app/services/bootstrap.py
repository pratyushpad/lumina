"""Startup seeding of the public demo session.

Runs the deterministic ingest against demo_docs/ (baked into the Docker image,
so the source PDFs survive ephemeral-storage restarts on HF Spaces). Chunks and
embeddings live in Postgres; if every demo document is already `ready` there
with chunks, seeding is a cheap no-op — safe to run on every boot.
